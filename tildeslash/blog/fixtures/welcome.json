We set out these principles below. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Lists\r\n\r\n### Ordered List\r\n\r\n1. The Internet is an integral part of modern life\u2014a key component in education, communication, collaboration, business, entertainment and society as a whole.\r\n2. The Internet is a global public resource that must remain open and accessible.\r\n3. The Internet must enrich the lives of individual human beings.\r\n4. Individuals\u2019 security and privacy on the Internet are fundamental and must not be treated as optional.\r\n5. Individuals must have the ability to shape the Internet and their own experiences on the Internet.\r\n6. The effectiveness of the Internet as a public resource depends upon interoperability (protocols, data formats, content), innovation and decentralized participation worldwide.\r\n7. Free and open source software promotes the development of the Internet as a public resource.\r\n8. Transparent community-based processes promote participation, accountability and trust.\r\n9. Commercial involvement in the development of the Internet brings many benefits; a balance between commercial profit and public benefit is critical.\r\n10. Magnifying the public benefit aspects of the Internet is an important goal, worthy of time, attention and commitment.\r\n\r\n### Unordered List\r\n\r\n\r\n* build and enable open-source technologies and communities that support the Manifesto\u2019s principles;\r\n* build and deliver great consumer products that support the Manifesto\u2019s principles;\r\n* use the Mozilla assets to keep the Internet an open platform;  \r\nassets means intellectual property such as: \r\n * copyrights\r\n * infrastructure\r\n * funds\r\n * reputation\r\n* promote models for creating economic value for the public benefit; \r\n* promote the Mozilla Manifesto principles in public discourse and within the Internet industry.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Links and Images\r\n\r\nThe [Mozilla](http://www.mozilla.org/) project is a global community of people who believe that openness, innovation, and opportunity are key to the continued health of the Internet. \r\n![Be the future](/static/img/fxos-btf.png)\r\n## Quote and Code\r\n\r\n> It is becoming increasingly difficult to trust the privacy properties of software and services we rely on to use the Internet. Governments, companies, groups and individuals may be surveilling us without our knowledge. This is particularly troubling when such surveillance is done by governments under statutes that provide limited court oversight and almost no room for public scrutiny.\r\n\r\n> As a result of laws in the US and elsewhere, prudent users must interact with Internet services knowing that despite how much any cloud-service company wants to protect privacy, at the end of the day most big companies must comply with the law. The government can legally access user data in ways that might violate the privacy expectations of law-abiding users. Worse, the government may force service operators to enable surveillance.\r\n\r\nConsider the + operator: `a = b + c;`\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nfor (var i = 0; i < BIG; i++) {\r\n    // Loop header starts here:\r\n    if (usuallyTrue())\r\n        commonPath();\r\n    else\r\n        uncommonPath();\r\n}\r\n```",
